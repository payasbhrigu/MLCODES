This was my first ever data science hackathon . I participated with my college friends and the problem was mobile price classification .
I helped my team achieve an accuracy of 95.4% after working hard for 2 weeks and using every possible machine learning model.
Finally I used keras to achieve this accuracy after tuning the model to its best.
